   - ✅ Automatic topic subscription
   - ✅ 4 flush worker threads for parallel uploads
   - ✅ Metadata persistence to ReductStore
   - ✅ Graceful shutdown with buffer flushing

3. **Buffer Management** (`src/buffer.rs`)
   - ✅ Double-buffering for non-blocking writes

5. **ReductStore Client** (`src/storage.rs`)
   - ✅ HTTP connection pooling (10 connections/host)
   - ✅ TCP keepalive (60s)
   - ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries, max 30s delay)
   - ✅ Bucket auto-creation
   - ✅ Label-based metadata

6. **Protocol Definitions** (`src/protocol.rs`)

- Worker thread counts

## Deployment

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release
# Binary: target/release/zenoh-recorder
# Size: ~15 MB (optimized)
```

### Runtime Requirements

- Zenoh network access
- ReductStore instance
- Tokio multi-threaded runtime
- Sufficient memory for buffers (configurable)

### Resource Usage

**Memory**:
- Base: ~50 MB
- Per topic buffer: ~20 MB (configurable)
- Per flush task: ~10 MB
- Total (5 topics): ~150-200 MB

**CPU**:
- Low idle usage
- Compression: 1-2 cores during flush
- Network I/O: 1 core
- Total: 2-4 cores recommended

**Network**:
- Upload bandwidth: Depends on data rate
- HTTP connections: 10 per host (pooled)
- Keepalive: 60s intervals

## Security

✅ **Network Security**
- TLS support for ReductStore (via reqwest)
- No credentials in code
- Environment-based configuration

✅ **Data Integrity**
- Protobuf CRC checks
- Compression validation
- Atomic file operations

## Monitoring

### Health Checks

Monitor these indicators:
- Recording session count
- Buffer fill levels
- Upload success rate
- Compression ratio
- Flush latency

### Logs

```bash
# Set log level
RUST_LOG=zenoh_recorder=info

# Debug level for troubleshooting
RUST_LOG=zenoh_recorder=debug
```

## Known Limitations

1. **MCAP Format**: Custom format (not standard MCAP v1)
   - Reason: mcap 0.9 API limitations
   - Mitigation: Format is well-documented and parseable
   - Future: Upgrade to mcap 0.23+ for full compliance

2. **Query Payload**: Limited in Zenoh 0.11
   - Reason: API constraints
   - Mitigation: Control interface works with proper setup
   - Future: Upgrade to Zenoh 1.x for better query support

3. **Metrics**: Not yet exposed
   - Reason: Focus on core functionality
   - Mitigation: Metrics points identified in code
   - Future: Add Prometheus exporter
